## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed `n`, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```JavaScript

// My Solution
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let arr = [1, 2];
  for (let i = 0; i < 99999; i++) {
    let fib = arr[i] + arr[i+1];
    if (fib <= n) {
      arr.push(fib)
    }
  };

  let even = []
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] % 2 === 0) {
      even.push(arr[i])
    };
  };

  return even.reduce((a, b) => a+b, 0)
};
```
